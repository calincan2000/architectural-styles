This is about one dream of mine which I have it since 2016, on which I'm working  on . 
If you go on the street and want to find out about the architecture of one beautiful building , 
by making a picture , the app  will provide  more information like : Art Nouveau, Brutalist architecture,
Gothic architecture,  The history of construction etc.

a.) How to run the project 
b). What are the various command line parameters which could be changed and how to change them.
